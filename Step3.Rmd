## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.


```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE) # 'echo' means R will print the code along with the results. 

rm(list = ls()) # clear workspace

library(sf)

```

# *PART ONE: User settings - choose model, scenarios, years of interest*

First, let's select which of the `models` you'd like to run. Highlight the word `models` and click 'Run' at the top right (or use the shortcut *Ctrl + Enter*). The available models correspond to numbers in the vector (e.g., HADGEM2-ES is [1]). In the inline code chunk below, enter the number between the brackets ([]) that corresponds with your model of interest.

`model <- models[2]` In this example, I am interested in running LOCA_CCSM4 so I entered '2'.  

Let's see what variables are available for that model. Run the code chunk below and the options will appear. 

```{r get-variables}

# Using the 'historical' folder just to get a sample of filenames. If we need to change this strategy no biggie.

dir_historical_ncdfs = paste("N:\\RStor\\mindyc\\afccm\\Climate Modeling\\Data\\", model, "\\historical", sep = "")

fileNames <- list.files(dir_historical_ncdfs, pattern = '.nc', full.names = FALSE)

variables <- unique(substr(fileNames, 1,7)) # Numbers 1 and 7 refer to character indexes within the file names (i.e., the first seven letters of the file names)

variables

```

Now we can see how the variables are labeled in this dataset, and we also have created a vector with their names. If you want to edit how they look, go ahead. It could be something like: 

```{r revise-variables}

variables <- c("pr", "tasmin", "tasmax")

```


```{r select AFB and years of interest}

AFB_Name <- "Homestead_ARB" # Can create a vector similar to 'models' above if desired

## Years of interest

historical_start_year <- 1976 # Start year of interest for the historical time period  
historical_end_year <- 2005 # End year of interest for the historical time period

future1_start_year <- 2026 # Start year of interest for the first future time period 
future1_end_year <- 2035 # End year of interest for the first future time period 

future2_start_year <- 2046 # Start year of interest for the second future time period 
future2_end_year <- 2055 # End year of interest for the second future time period 

```

# PART TWO: Let 'er Rip!


```{r directories, echo=FALSE}

dir_netcdfs = paste("N:\\RStor\\mindyc\\afccm\\Climate Modeling\\Data\\", model, sep = "")

# The last two are straight from the original script. Will change so that directories can be set more generally in 'settings'

#dir_output_csvs = "N:\\RStor\\mindyc\\afccm\\Climate Modeling\\Results_LOCA_V2" # output csv

#dir_functions = "N:\\RStor\\mindyc\\afccm\\Climate Modeling\\Software Apps\\R scripts\\LOCA_V2" # scripts that call in functions for analysis

```

```{r create-array}

# Not sure if this only applies to LOCA, as comment implies. Can cross that bridge when we come to it. 

scenario_yr_array = array(1:15, dim=c(5,3))

scenario_yr_array[1,1:3] = c("historical", historical_start_year, historical_end_year)
scenario_yr_array[2,1:3] = c("rcp45", future1_start_year, future1_end_year)
scenario_yr_array[3,1:3] = c("rcp45", future2_start_year, future2_end_year)
scenario_yr_array[4,1:3] = c("rcp85", future1_start_year, future1_end_year)
scenario_yr_array[5,1:3] = c("rcp85", future2_start_year, future2_end_year)

```


```{r historical-files-variable1}

histFileNames_var1 <- list.files(dir_historical_ncdfs, pattern = variables[1], full.names = TRUE) # partition files by variable

pattern <- paste(seq(scenario_yr_array[1,2], scenario_yr_array[1,3], 1), collapse = "|") # partition by years of interest

DT <- data.table(histFileNames_var1, result = grepl(pattern, histFileNames_var1))  
histDT_var1 <- DT %>% filter(result == TRUE) # spot check the number of observations - should equal the number of years in the time period of interest





hist_filenames_tmax <- fileNames %>% # this will have to be changed to make it more 'universal'. I have ideas but this works for the trial run for now. 
  str_subset("historical") %>% # time period of interest
  str_subset("tasmax")  # variable of interest

```
